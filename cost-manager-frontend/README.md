<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
- [x] The code uses ReactJS for the front-end development of the application.

- [ ] The code includes the development of a separate library that wraps the use of the local
      storage **(although it is not included)**

- [ ] The code includes the development of a separate library that exposes its functionality through asynchronous functions **(although it is not included)**

- [ ] The code includes the ability for the user to add new cost items with the sum, category, and description **(although it is not included)**

- [ ] The code includes the ability for the user to get a detailed report per specific month and year **(although it is not included)**

<hr/>

However, the code does not fully implement all of the requirements outlined in the project description, such as:

- [ ] **The data is not stored in local storage.**

- [ ] **The code does not include a UI for the user to select a specific month and year for the report.**

- [ ] **The code does not include any categories for the expenses.**

- [ ] **The library for local storage is not provided in the code snippet.**
